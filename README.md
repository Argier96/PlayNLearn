# Play N Learn
<p>
Play N Learn is an iOS App created using Xcode with programming language Swift. This app is created to help young children of age group 2-4 years learn a variety of skills in a fun and engaging way. This app is created as a school project for our course while learning about Swift and SwiftUI. This app was built following scrum practice with a weekly sprint review. This application consists of three small games such as : number game, colour game and a shape game.
